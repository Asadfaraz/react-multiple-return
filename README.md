# Multiple Return (Page View) in React

In this project I learned that we can show and hide multiple components on page conditionally.

For example in this example I am fetching a github user from its API and if the user exists
first the page will show Loading and after downloading the user info it will show the user name.
But if there was an error like user does not exist then it will show Error on screen.
